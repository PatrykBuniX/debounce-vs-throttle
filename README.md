# Debounce vs Throttle

## What is it?

Debounce and throttle techniques interactive demo with JavaScript implementation code and short explanation. Created with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework.

## Why?

There are two reasons I've created this project:

- to play around with svelte (first time using it - and yes, I love it),
- to learn debounce and throttle better,

## Run it locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PatrykBuniX/debounce-vs-throttle
npm install
npm run dev
```
